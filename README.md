# Levvel Cli Starter Net Api
A starter project for an API [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) and [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)

## Overview
This repository offers a basic structure for an Api project following a Clean Architecture. Swagger is added for an easy and quicker implementation. It already holds controllers, models, services, interfaces and a generic repository pattern that will help with the communication between the Api and our database.
